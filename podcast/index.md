#### A podcast that's in alpha, about how I make and think

Like so many others in this post-covid world, I've decided to make a podcast. The thought is to make 10-15 minute episodes about either:
* A process that I do when making things;
* A project that I'm currently working on (and a specific problem I'm solving for it); or
* A design concept I'm thinking about

I've made three 'alpha' podcasts, to both try out some processes for making podcasts and to try out some content. I'd really appreciate any feedback you have on them.
