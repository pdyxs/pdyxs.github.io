<div class="lead">
<p>Why is a hard question, and not one that I'm going to answer in short sound-bytes. At least, not yet.</p>
<p>I write a blog over on <a href="http://medium.com/@pdyxs" target="_blank">Medium</a>, and some of what I write is about the motivations and approaches behind my works. I'll put those pieces here.</p>

[A piece](https://artplusmarketing.com/finding-the-right-problems-for-citizen-science-24e454669b0){:target="_blank"} excribing the possibility space for citizen science.
