Like a lot of artists, I have a pretty complicated relationship with deadlines. They're vital, but need to be tempered by a certain amount of "it's ready when it's ready".

I also like to think about what I'm going to work on moving forward and see the usefulness of having clear goals and direction, but I also value being able to pivot pretty quickly.

So with that in mind, here's a bit of a future timeline for my practice. It's a combination of deadlines and goals, and I'll flesh it out as things become clearer.
