I live in the early 21st century, a time that will likely be known as:
* 'back when waterfront property was valuable',
* 'back when people ate meat from actual animals',
* 'back when we let people control wheeled death machines',
* 'that time when politics went a bit off the rails', and/or
* 'back before the (climate&#124;bitcoin&#124;quantum&#124;robo&#124;CRISPR&#124;nuclear a)pocalypse'
