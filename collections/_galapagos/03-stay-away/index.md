On the flight into the Galapagos, everyone is shown a video (OK, I was busy watching The Expanse on my iPad, but was filled in on it later) where muppets explain that you shouldn’t come within 2 metres of any wildlife. If you stay still and they come to you, it’s ok, but you should still avoid touching them: your scent could make them an outcast, and possibly stop children and mothers from finding each other.
