As an equatorial archipelago, the last thing I expected to find in the Galapagos was a semi-arid desert. But it turns out that the lowlands of the islands are incredibly dry, and getting enough fresh water reliably and ecologically sustainably is one of the major issues that the government faces.

Right now water is shipped in, which is both expensive and environmentally problematic. While the islands have taken great steps towards sustainability, sourcing fresh water for the communities here continues to be the exception.
