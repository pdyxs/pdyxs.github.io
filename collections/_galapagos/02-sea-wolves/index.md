Sea Lions are everywhere in San Cristobal, and they’ve been left alone enough that they really don’t care about humans. The Spanish name for sea lions means ‘Sea Wolves’, which is much more appropriate: they basically act like lazy puppies, playing and spreading themselves out in the sun. Which isn't completely surprising: they’re genetically closer to dogs than cats.
