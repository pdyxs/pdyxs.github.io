title: is this website like this?

One thing I've been fascinated with for a long time is how we present information to those around us. Right now, our best approaches to presenting information tend to be didactic: we tell people facts and expect them to accept those facts.

For a while now, I've wanted to find ways to create informational interfaces that are driven by conversation and inquiry instead. If people see something they don't understand or are curious about, our interfaces should encourage them to ask those questions.

If I'm going to build myself a website, I might as well try out some of these concepts. So this website is a very *very* early attempt at a question-driven interface. I figure if I can find a cool way to explain myself, I might be able to apply those same approaches to other concepts.

Also, once I realised that '.wtf' domains were available, there really wasn't any other choice.
