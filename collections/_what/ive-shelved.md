One of the things I've come to really appreciate is the value of a good shelf: projects that you've made some significant progress on, but which don't make sense to continue work on just yet. I even <a href="https://medium.com/@pdyxs/not-quite-abandoned-c7421eee4205" target="_blank">wrote a blog post</a> about shelving projects.

Here, you can find such projects.
