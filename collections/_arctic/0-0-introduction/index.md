It’s been a few weeks since I was in Svalbard, and I really don’t feel any more equipped to talk about my experience there than I did before. In the same way that a photograph lacks context: the sounds and smells; the people and peripheral vision - so too does any attempt to summarise what happened lack the essence of the experience.

So instead of trying to get at the whole, I’m going to try and get at some of the parts. Over the next few weeks I’ll be posting thoughts, facts, insights and anecdotes from the trip that go with the (rather amateur) photos that I took. These will be made available here, and you can [subscribe to email updates](https://tinyletter.com/pdyxs){:target="_blank"} if that’s your cup of tea.
