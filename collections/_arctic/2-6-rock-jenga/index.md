The rules of Rock Jenga:
* You can play Rock Jenga whenever there's lots of rocks around. Ideally, there's a good combination of smaller and bigger rocks to play with.
* Choose a large rock to be the base
* Take it in turns to add a rock to the base or to any other rock in the structure on top of it
* You can take as much time as you want, but once you pick up a rock to use, you must use it
* If any rock from the structure falls off/hits the ground, you're eliminated
