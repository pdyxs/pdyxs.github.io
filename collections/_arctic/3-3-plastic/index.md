We saw a lot of plastic on our landings across Svalbard, and it was sobering to realise that none of it came from visitors to Svalbard (as people are careful not to leave anything behind). Instead, it was all plastic that had floated all the way north from the rest of the world.

It was strange to see a place where the more remote areas often had more plastic: visitors tend to clean up when they arrive, so the more heavily trafficked areas can often be cleaner.
