While on board, we were allowed (after signing a waiver or two) to climb the mast of the Antigua. You get a harness and 2 clips that you have to constantly move as you move up and down the rigging.

When I was about halfway up the mast, a strange quiet came across the deck of the Antigua. I didn’t think much of it, my mind focused on getting up the mast with my slowly freezing hands (pro tip: if you have suitable gloves for climbing, wear them if you climb a mast in the arctic). When I got to the platform, Shohei (one of the other artists who’d climbed up the other side) pointed out 2 polar bears that were making their way down the coast.

We ended up following the bears for a few hours, watching them steadily walk and swim through the arctic landscape.
