These two images were taken on different days: the top was taken on a beach; and the bottom is a piece of coastline we sailed past the next day.

Both, through different forces of water and erosion, have arrived at a similar pattern: tracing out the shapes of trees (though the top image is undoubtedly more spectacular). It never ceases to amaze me how these forms and structures tend to appear throughout the natural world.
