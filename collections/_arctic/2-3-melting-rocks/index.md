You can find rocks all across glaciers: they get picked up, ground down and tossed around by the turbulence, and sometimes they end up on top of the ice. Rocks trap and radiate heat, so as soon as these rocks are in the sun, theyâ€™ll start melting the snow and ice around them. In summer, rocks end up sinking into the ice, creating these small puddles all across the glacier.
