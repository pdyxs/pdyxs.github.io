One of the strange things about Svalbard is that any human trace before 1945 is automatically protected under cultural heritage. This is largely because Svalbard doesn't have any indigenous population, and so its history is both sparse and recent.

The result is that throughout the island, you can find the remains of huts, traps and random pieces of wood that you aren't supposed to touch. What's more incredible is that the wood doesn't rot: it just survives like this, frozen in time.
