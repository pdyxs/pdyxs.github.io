Chaos Theory Games is a bespoke software development studio that specializes in using games and gamification to teach new concepts in a fun and effective way, or make research projects more effective using the latest technologies. As a Leaad Producer, I lead projects, working with stakeholders and the team to ensure that we create the best possible product.
