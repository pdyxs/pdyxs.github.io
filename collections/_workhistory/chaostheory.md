Chaos Theory Games is an independent games studio, working primarily in the games for change space.

While working at Chaos Theory, I’ve designed, developed and managed a wide variety of games projects, including web platforms, mobile games and museum pieces. I’ve worked with a range of clients, including start-ups, science museums, non-for-profits and pharmaceutical companies.

As the second producer at the company, I helped shape the way that Chaos Theory manages projects, focusing on clear communication to both clients and teams. To this end, I developed custom-built dashboards for the team that helped managers and team members better understand the status of projects.
