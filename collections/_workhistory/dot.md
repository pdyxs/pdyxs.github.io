Dot is a startup that's using cryptocurrency and non-fungible tokens to make ownership of digital assets more real. They contracted me to prototype a location-based game for the launch of their platform.

The game I prototyped mapped the stars in the night sky and their relative position to our solar system to GPS co-ordinates, and had players search their local universe for alien artefacts.
