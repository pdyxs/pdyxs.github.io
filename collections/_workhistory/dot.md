Dot is a startup that's using cryptocurrency and non-fungible tokens to make ownership of digital assets more real. They contracted me to prototype a location-based game for the launch of their platform.

The game I prototyped mapped the stars in the night sky and their relative position to our solar system to GPS co-ordinates, and had players search their local universe for alien artefacts. The goal was to give players an innate understanding of the geography of our stellar neighbourhood.

The contract culminated in several playtests of the game prototype in San Francisco. Both the players and the client delighted in travelling their city and the universe at the same time.
