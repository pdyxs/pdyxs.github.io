3P Learning is an Australian education technology company which develops games and interactive media to teach school students across all age groups. During my time there, I've worked on IntoScience and Mathletics as a designer, developer, product owner and product manager.

While working there, I led a team to review and improve the UX processes across the entire organisation, and was part of the Creative Content Team - a design strike force that focused on creating and prototyping highly effective educational content.

As a part of the Creative Content Team, I designed and developed <a href="https://pdyxs.wtf/what/projects/numbeanies">Numbeanies</a>.
