3P Learning is an Australian education technology company which develops games and interactive media to teach school students across all age groups. During my time there, I've worked on IntoScience and Mathletics as a designer, developer, product owner and product manager.

While at 3P, the IntoScience team became known in the organisation for our cohesiveness and our ability to combine technology and creativity with great design and development practices. This lead to me leading a team to review and improve the UX processes of the entire organisation, and the creation of the Creative Content Team - a design strike force that focused on creating and prototyping highly effective educational content.

As a part of the Creative Content Team, I designed and developed <a href="https://pdyxs.wtf/what/projects/numbeanies">Numbeanies</a> (more detail on that below).
