Equal Reality is a social enterprise which creates diversity and inclusion training in virtual reality, allowing its users to experience bias firsthand.

While at Equal Reality, I implemented software engineering practices across the company’s projects, bringing the company’s creator’s suite into git and implementing unit testing and continuous integration. I also designed and developed features for the apps themselves, including a suite of accessibility features for VR.
