Equal Reality is a social enterprise which creates diversity and inclusion training in virtual reality, allowing its users to live the experiences of minorities and experience bias firsthand.

While at Equal Reality, I've implemented software engineering practices across the company's projects, bringing the company's project and creator's suite into git and implementing unit testing and continuous integration. This has allowed the company to build apps far more reliably and sustainably, with a shared codebase across multiple Unity applications.

I've also developed tools that improve the app development workflow and designed and developed features for the apps themselves, including a comprehensive suite of accessibility features for Virtual Reality.
