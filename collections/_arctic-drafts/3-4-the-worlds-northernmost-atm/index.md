At the end of the trip, we returned to Longyearbyen, home of the World's Northernmost ATM, the World's Northernmost Church, and a bar called Svalbar.

Towns in Svalbard are unusual: they're the only place where you're allowed to walk around without an armed guide (in case of polar bears), and all doors are unlocked (so you have somewhere to go if a polar bear shows up).
