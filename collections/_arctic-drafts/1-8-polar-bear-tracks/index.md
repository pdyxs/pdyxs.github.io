Polar bears move a lot: they’re constantly walking at a languid pace that’s faster than a human can run. So they cover a lot of ground. We found polar bear tracks on at least 4 separate occasions, in both mud and snow. There’s something unnerving about realising that you’re following a set of polar bear tracks, but it’s very unlikely that you’ll catch up with the bear which made them.
