Cybersecurity ethics is a narrative-driven game, occurring in the virtual desktop of a cybersecurity consultant's computer. Players receive messages about a variety of cybersecurity issues, and need to decide on the best way to respond. Every message sent moves the clock forward, meaning that the player must carefully choose their priorities as a crisis takes shape.

A major challenge for this project was creating narrative systems for non-linear multi-threaded narratives, where different conversations a player can engage with can affect each other. I lead the design of systems that would allow non-techhnical writers to create these narratives, helped our designers to prototype the narrative so that we could test it, and managed the development of the final product.
