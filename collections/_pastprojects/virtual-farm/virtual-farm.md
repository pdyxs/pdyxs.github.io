Virtual Farm is a museum exhibit at Gateway to Science, where guests can manage one of 4 farms on a tabletop computer. The game was designed based on real farming practices in North Dakota, where Gateway to Science is based.

As the producer of this project, I was the primary contact with Gateway to Science, and worked with them to develop a concept for a game that would best teach farming practices in a museum environment. Through prototyping and playtesting, we honed the design, and I managed the development of the final product.
