The other thing I’ve changed to make Fate’s role easier to deal with was to split it up into levels. For a first game, you’re “the Fates’ Intern”, only dealing with one Mortal’s destiny, and having limited power. As you increase your level, you increase the number of destinies you need to fulfil, but also the amount of power you have to do it. Fate’s win condition is all-or-nothing, so it becomes a sort of bet: do you think you can fulfil all the destinies in front of you?
