Meet “In Fate’s Hands”, a card game where one player is Fate, and they hold all the cards.

All other players are mortals on an Odyssean voyage, desperately trying to survive the journey home. But Fate has destinies laid out for them, destinies that Fate must fulfil in order to win. Fate can offer mortals powerful cards, but the mortals must trust Fate enough to accept them.
