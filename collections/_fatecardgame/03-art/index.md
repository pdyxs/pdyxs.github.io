For art, I’m working with the talented Vicente Araullo-Peters (@vicsprints), after seeing this linocut print and getting really excited about how it could fit into a card game like this. While it’s unclear whether linocut prints will actually figure into the game (I’m trying to keep this project fairly small, and linocut is both time consuming and expensive), it’s provided a really great starting point for how we move forward, and it’s great to have Vic on board.
