title: Where it’s from
---
I’ve had “In Fate’s Hands” knocking around in my head since Train Jam in 2016 (a train trip across the US where we all made games), stemming from thoughts about unfairness and how we deal with it. I want people to explore the feeling of having everything stacked against you, of trying but failing to defy the odds, or of coasting to a victory not of your making, and having to decide what to do with your extra power. All while having a good time.
