The goal for this project is to build and release a simple card game. For that reason, I’ve decided to do a “humble kickstarter”. What that means is that the goal is very small (in the hundreds of dollars range), literally just enough to do a limited print run. This lets me dip my feet in the kickstarter water without having to dedicate months to building a campaign, and also just means that I’ll have released something.
