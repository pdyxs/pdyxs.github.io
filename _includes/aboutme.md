I'm Paul Sztajer, a Software Engineer and Creative Technologist. My favourite thing to do is to develop works that illuminate complex systems and ideas, particularly in the realm of science.

I studied Physics and Software Engineering at University and then dived into the world of games and education. Along the way, I started a game studio, worked on science and maths games used in schools, designed interactive theatre, and been the head of technology of a VR company.
