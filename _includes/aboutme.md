I'm Paul Sztajer, a creative technologist. My favourite thing to do is to develop works that illuminate complex systems and ideas, particularly in the realm of science.

I studied Physics and Software Engineering at University, and produced sketch comedy shows in my free time. Since then, Iâ€™ve dived into the world of games (starting SeeThrough Studios along the way) and education (working at [3P Learning](http://3plearning.com) as a designer and developer of science and maths educational software).
