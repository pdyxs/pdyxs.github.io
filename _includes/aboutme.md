I am Paul Sztajer, an interactive artist who tends to develop works that illuminate complexity, especially in the realm of science.

At university I learnt Physics, Software Engineering and how to produce sketch comedy shows. I've since delved into the world of games (starting [SeeThrough Studios](seethroughstudios.com) along the way) and education (working at [3P Learning](3plearning.com) as a designer of science and maths educational software), always focusing on how interactivity can illuminate complex systems and ideas.
