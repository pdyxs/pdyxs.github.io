3P Learning is an Australian education technology company which develops games and interactive media to teach school students across all age groups. During my time there, I've worked on IntoScience and Mathletics as a designer, developer, product owner and product manager.

Once I started travelling, I continued to work for 3P Learning as a Freelancer. As a part of that, I designed and developed [Numbeanies](/what/projects/numbeanies).
