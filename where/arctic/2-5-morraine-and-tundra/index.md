title: Moraine and Tundra

The terrain that’s revealed as the snow and ice thaw comes in two main types: moraine and tundra. Moraine is a combination of mud and dirt that’s just been blended through a glacier and dumped out the other side. It’s muddy and just starting to support life, and walking through it can be dicey (I almost lost my knee-high wellingtons quite a few times to mud). Over time it turns into tundra: more settled terrain, generally covered in moss and flowers and surprisingly springy to walk on. This island has both moraine (above) and tundra (below): you can actually see where the glacier last advanced to before it retreated once more.
