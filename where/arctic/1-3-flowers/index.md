While we were visiting the surge glacier, we saw some of the first flowers starting to bloom as the landscape thawed in the never-ending sunlight. We saw more and more of them throughout the trip.

This really puzzled me, as I didn’t see any pollinators - and generally flowers exist to attract pollinators. Apparently there are some pollinators (flies), but they’re scarce. Because flowering plants can’t rely on pollinators, they’re able to reproduce asexually as well, ensuring they survive either way.
