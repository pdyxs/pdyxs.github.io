The Neighbourhood re-imagines the 8912 stars visible from Earth with the naked eye as a city.

Each building's height and brightness is based on the star's brightness. Their colour is based on star's colour. The reflections in the water are the stars' emission spectra.

Buildings are arranged based on their distance from the galactic plane (the centre of which lies in the middle).

Somewhere in the image, small and dim, lies our sun.
