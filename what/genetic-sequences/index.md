Genetic Sequences is an exploratory project, looking into different ways of visualising and exploring genetic sequences. The goal is to eventually produce an interactive artwork that helps people understand the basic structures of DNA.

To begin with, I am visualising the Ebola virus genome, as it is a simple and publicly available data set. The plan is to use this small genome to develop visualisation techniques and approaches before expanding to more complex genomic structures.
