Numbeanies: Number Forest is an app that uses physical cards and augmented reality to help children learn basic numeracy skills. It was developed by 3P Learning as a part of the Mathletics product.

Numbeanies is the result of extensive design and user research into how Augmented Reality can best be deployed in a classroom environment. It was designed in consultation with teachers and educational experts, and was tested several times in a classroom environment.
