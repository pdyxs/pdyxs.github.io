Completely Accurate Thought Simulator is an attempt to help people understand what a quantum computer is and how it differs from a regular computer.

To do this, it allows its users to play with a quantum circuit, utilising the actual operations and standards utilised by academics in the field.

To connect the world of quantum computing with something more immediately accessible, each bit will represent a cat's opinion of a person or concept. Players will then construct narratives (circuits) which change the cat's mind (quantum state) in order to create an intended result.
