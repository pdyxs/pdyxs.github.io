Quantum Byte is an attempt to help people understand what a quantum computer is and how it differs from a regular computer.

To do this, it allows its users to play with a quantum circuit, utilising the actual operations and standards utilised by academics in the field.

It's also going to be a dating simulator simulator, using the metaphor of people's feelings for each other as a proxy for quantum states.
